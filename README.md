# towardsMobileStressAnomalyDetection

Implemented various convolutional Multi-Layer Perceptron Nueral Networks and other machine learning algorithms for classification of electrodermal activity as stressed vs. relaxed sessions. Also, variational modeling and generative approaches were attempted with this dataset - they allude to more practical/computationally-tractable follow-up work in the area of ANOMALY stress detection (dehydration, panic, etc.). The notebook is well-documented and describes the process.
